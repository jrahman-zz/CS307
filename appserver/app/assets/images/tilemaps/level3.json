The brand new Deluxe Mushmellow, with slick new tire upgrades, plus a cloud so incase I drive off the edge will bring me back on to the course will cost me a lot of money! I need you to write me a program to figure out if this will be in my price range if not I can use it to figure out if i can buy other karts!\n\n\nSo if the Deluxe Mushmellow kart is 800, dollars the new tires is 125, and the cloud kite is 142 dollars how much is that going to cost total? Also, in Mario Land there is a 12.8% tax on final purchase. Then can you see if that number is less than my 1356 dollars that I have in my pocket?  If so, then you say \u201cYAY! I CAN BUY IT!\u201d and if not  \u201cI need more money!\u201d\nCan you write me a program to add 3 items and then adds on the tax and compares if i have enough money or not and outputs the correct response?\n",
